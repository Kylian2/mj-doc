# Musical Juggling Documentation

This documentation explains the key points and things to know about the serious game project for learning musical juggling.

It includes explanations on using components from the `mj-lib` library and other more general components.

This game is developed in WebXR with React Three Fiber technology and certain dependencies. In some cases, it may be necessary to have the same dependency to make an element work.

Here are the repositories where you can find the source code :

- Repository containing the juggling lib's source code : [mj-lib repository](https://github.com/kunchtler/mj-lib)
